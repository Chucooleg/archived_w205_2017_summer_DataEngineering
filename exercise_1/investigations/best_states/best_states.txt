<Dedicated Tables>

intermediate_procedures
analytical_procedures_by_state


<Usage>

“Intermediate_procedures” same usage as in question 1.

“analytical_procedures_by_state” table is constructed to summarize
statistics across up to 36 procedure performances for each state. Key columns
“procedures_mean” and “procedures_std_err” having similar
meaning and usage as “analytical_procedures_by_provider” table in
question 1.

The Spark-sql query performs ranking of our states. First, based on
“procedures_mean”, it ranks states in descending order and divided
them into 5 ranked buckets with roughly 10 hospitals each. Then, within each
bucket, the query rank states based on “procedures_std_err” in
ascending order. Therefore, the query output shows 10 states within bucket 1
according to “procedures_mean” and ordered according to
“procedures_std_err”.


<Challenges>

Similar problems and solutions as question 1


<Data Considered>

States that reported too few procedures or too low a proportion of hospitals
participating also should not be considered. Therefore, states reporting fewer
than 26 (75%) of all 36 unique procedures or less than 75% of their hospitals
are excluded. This filters the list down to 49 hospitals.


<Conclusion>

Our query returns Florida, New York State and Virginia to the top three states
for best healthcare. Theses states have weighted, standardized procedure
scores large enough to be placed in the first bucket, and the small enough
standard errors to be placed top three within the same bucket.

<Usage>

“Intermediate_procedures” same usage as in question 1.
“analytical_procedures_stats” table is constructed to provide
procedure statistics summarize across all hospitals. Key column
“std_err” measures variability of each procedure based on the sample
standard deviation and sample size available for each procedure. A procedure
with higher “std_err” is estimated to have greater variability across
all hospitals.
The Spark-sql query performs ranking of our procedures based on
“std_err” in descending order.


<Challenges>

Each procedure is reported by different number of hospitals so we don’t
have a census but a sample here. This difference in terms of observation size
can throw off our measure of variability. Therefore, in the
“analytical_procedures_stats” table, our variability measure is
“std_err” – the standard error rather than standard deviation
across varying number of hospitals.


<Data Considered>

Procedures reported by too few hospitals should not be considered. Therefore,
procedures with less than 2403 (50%) hospitals are excluded. This filters the
list down to 21 procedures.


<Conclusion>

The top three and the seventh measures are all related to performance of the
Emergency Department. We can imagine that depending on the locations of the
hospitals, they expect different flows of patients. For instance, a hospital
in the rural area would expect many less patients than a hospital in the urban
area, especially one surrounded by traffic black spots.
